<h1>Re: Peter Smith University Application</h1>
    <p>Dear Mr. Smith,</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at University of Coolness. I can answer some of the following questions for you. I hope that helps.</p>

    <!--h2 headers used to define subheadings throughout letter-->
    <h2>Payment Deadlines</h2>
    <p>We require a deposit of $750 due at the beginning of each semester. Once the semester begins you have <strong>14 days</strong> to make a complete payment on the account. With that being said, our financial aid team at the university is amazing! We work with students where they're at based on their household and income to find a payment plan that works best. If you require this type of assistance, I'd suggest reaching out to our the Financial Aid Department ASAP, as it is a busy time for them.</p>

    <p><i>Please note if you're recieving any government assistance, the Financial Aid Department will be in direct contact with them and notified, there is no need to contact them if your account still shows balance after the 14 days.  </i></p>
    
    <p>If you have any other questions about payment deadlines and tuition fees, please go to the <a href="https://www.uofcoolness.edu/payment-terms/">Payment Terms and Deadlines </a> on the university website.</p>

Since our Spring/Summer semester has just begun, the next semester you would be able to start classes is the Fall 2024, beginning on September 5th, 2024. If the fall does not work for you, you can submit a "Temporary Withdrawl" application, notifying the university of your intent to begin at a later semester after a recent acceptance.</p>
